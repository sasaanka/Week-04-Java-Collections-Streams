## Overview

In Week 4, we explored **Java Generics**, the **Collections Framework** (including Lists, Sets, Maps, and Queues), and Java I/O Streams. We also dove into **Exception Handling**, **Regular Expressions**, **JUnit Testing**, and **Java 8 Features** like Lambdas and Streams. Each topic builds upon the previous weeks, giving us a solid foundation in advanced Java programming.
